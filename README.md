`from nrclex import NRCLex`<br><br>


*#Instantiate NRCLex object, you can pass your own dictionary filename in json format.*<br>

`text_object = NRCLex(txt_file='Spanish-NRC-EmoLex.txt')`<br><br>


*#You can pass your raw text to this method(for best results, 'text' should be unicode).*<br>

`text_object.load_raw_text(text: str)`<br><br>


*#You can pass your already tokenized text as a list of tokens, if you want to use an already tokenized input.
This usage assumes that the text is correctly tokenized and does not make use of TextBlob.*<br>

`text_object.load_token_list(list_of_tokens: list)`<br><br>


*#Return words list.*<br>

`text_object.words`<br><br>


*#Return sentences list.*<br>

`text_object.sentences`<br><br>


*#Return affect list.*<br>

`text_object.affect_list`<br><br>


*#Return affect dictionary.*<br>

`text_object.affect_dict`<br><br>


*#Return raw emotional counts.*<br>

`text_object.raw_emotion_scores`<br><br>
